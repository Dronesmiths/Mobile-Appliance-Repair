# AI Pilots: Blog & Cornerstone Content Strategy

To dominate local search, the site must move beyond "Service Pages" and establish **Intent Ownership** through cornerstone pillars and project-driven blogs.

## 1. The Cornerstone Pillars (The "God" Articles)
Identify 3-5 massive guides that establish the brand as THE authority in the niche/location.
- **Example**: "The Ultimate Homeowner's Guide to Maintaining Modern Kitchen Appliances"
- **Example**: "How to Extend the Life of Your Refrigerator in the High Desert Heat"
- **Goal**: 2,000+ words, internal links to EVERY service page, and external links to local community resources.

## 2. Project Spotlights (Case Studies)
For every major project finished, create a "Proof of Work" post.
- **Components**:
    - **The Problem**: (e.g., "Family in Lancaster with a full fridge and a dead compressor")
    - **The Solution**: "Our Emergency Same-Day Refrigerator Recovery"
    - **The Visuals**: (Before/After WebP images)
    - **The Locality**: Mention city landmarks or specific neighborhood names.

## 3. PAA Cluster Posts (Search Volume Capture)
Use the "People Also Ask" questions from [SEO_ROADMAP.md](SEO_ROADMAP.md) to create short-form (500-800 word) value posts.
- **Topic**: "How much does washer repair cost in Palmdale?"
- **Topic**: "Why is my dryer taking two cycles to dry clothes?"

## 4. Technical Blog Implementation (Static Version)
